# Accessing the NoSQL Database, Just As Simple As That!

This usefull useless API makes it easy to understand (personally) the way we get an API! And use it...

First, I recommend you to use two terminals, simultaneously, one to backend, one to front.

# Backend: 
Run "npm test". 

You can check at the package.json, this command makes the installation of all packages and run the server, using nodemon, at port 5000.

# Frontend:
Run "yarn start".

You'll get a react web page, using axios to access the backend API. Make it happen, run the test, if you want to!

# Important to say:

All code is written with portuguese commentaries, just to get easier. There's more documentation in english to get started!
